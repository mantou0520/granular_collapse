# granular_collapse
code for testing the collapse of granular columns

In this practice, we use a library called Mechsys (http://mechsys.nongnu.org/)

column.cpp contains everything about the setup of the granular packing, the shape of the particles and shape 
of the granular columns.

column.inp is the input file
